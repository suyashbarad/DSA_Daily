DSA Daily — My Daily Coding Practice

Welcome to DSA Daily, my personal repository where I solve one Data Structures & Algorithms problem every single day.
This helps me build consistency, improve logic, and strengthen my core programming skills.

Goals

Practice DSA daily using C.

Build strong problem-solving skills for interviews.

Improve logic, patterns, and coding speed.

Maintain consistency through daily commits.

Daily Progress Log

Day 2	day2_largestNo.c	Largest Number in Array	Arrays	Done
Day 3	day3_palindrome.c	Check Palindrome	Strings / Logic	Done
Day 4	day4_ReverseString.c	Reverse a String	Strings	Done
Day 5	day5_elemFreq.c	Count Element Frequency	Arrays / Hash Map	Done
Day 6	day6_ZeroToEnd.c	Move Zeroes to End	Two Pointers	Done

My Learning Style

I focus on:

Real-life analogies

Memory tricks

Clean and clear logic

Simple code over complexity

This makes concepts easier to understand and remember.

Technologies Used

C/C++ Programming

Git & GitHub

VS Code

Daily consistency

Future Plans

Add time and space complexity for every problem

Add more advanced DSA topics

Implement linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, searching, sorting

Add LeetCode-style problems
